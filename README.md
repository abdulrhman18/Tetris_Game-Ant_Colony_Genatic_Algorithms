# Tetris_Game-Ant_Colony_Genatic_Algorithms
üìå Task 1 ‚Äì Genetic Algorithm for Tetris
In this task, we implemented a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to play a simplified version of the classic game Tetris. Our goal was to develop a move evaluation function and evolve a set of contribution factors (chromosomes) to optimize gameplay performance. The algorithm evaluated game board states based on features like gaps, column heights, and score gain, and iteratively improved decision-making through evolution.

Key components:

Custom fitness evaluation of moves.

Evolution over multiple generations.

Logging of optimal chromosome values.

Final test run using best evolved values over 600 pieces.

üìå Task 2 ‚Äì Ant Colony Optimization for TSP
The second task involved solving a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). We tested our algorithm on sets of 10 and 20 cities, using various numbers of ant agents (1, 5, 10, 20), and analyzed the pheromone updates and optimal path convergence across 50 iterations.

Key highlights:

Distance matrices generated randomly and consistently reused across configurations.

Pheromone maps updated iteratively to reflect path quality.

Analysis and comparison of results based on different agent counts and city sets.

Discussion of scalability from 10 to 20 cities.

ü§ù Team Collaboration
These tasks were completed collaboratively by our team of five students. Each team member actively contributed to the research, coding, testing, and reporting of the two assignments. We ensured regular communication and efficient task distribution to meet both technical and academic goals.
